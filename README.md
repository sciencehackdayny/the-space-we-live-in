[project] team "manifold mixer" developing a depth color sensor project to explain space concepts

## TEAM MEMBERS

* Alia
* Evan
* Lucy

## PROBLEM 

Spacetime is complex. We want to explain the multi-layered space aspect of String Theory in a creative and understandable way.

## PURPOSE

Using Kinnect Depth sensors and footage from particle tracking chambers, we want to represent an artistic representation of the multi dimensional nature of Spacetime. We want the viewer to see how they can visualize themselves in a space with hidden dimensions all around them.
